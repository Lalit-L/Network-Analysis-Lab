# Network-Analysis-Lab
A project where I try to learn more about computer networking and the effect of attacks

There isn't a YouTube video of the project or any shareable code as it was a project done on virtual machines. Please read the document to see my journey and also the user-manual I created.
I made the manual so others could try the process I went through, and so I could look back on it in the future when I have more experience and be able to figure out exactly where I made mistakes.
